the key steps for a data science project:
1. project planning
2. data collection
3. data cleaning
4. EDA
5. model building
6. production

1. project planning:
have a good idea
-> look for data and then select the project
-> think about problem to solve then look for data

approach 1st: brainstorm ideas
do projects related to agriculture if you want to get into that
industry as a data scientist
eg. you want to check how crops perform under different weather conditions


2. data collection
extremely different for every project
go to the site from where you get the data
use scraping tools from google searches to take the data
implement in the specific IDE to get the data
